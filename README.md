News 0.1
========

This is a simple PHP news portal, I will code it for fun and to sharpen my skills.

Quick and Easy installation
===========================

1- Create Mysql database from any frontend such as "phpmyadmin" if you are working from localhost.
2- Copy the content of "news.sql" to your new database there is one table only for users till this moment.
3- Connect to your database, You need to edit "config/database.php" file it's very easy to edit it everthing is clear.
4- Edit the path of "news" depending on the location of the script you will find the paths file inside "config/paths.php"
you can rename the folder as you wish, but don't forget to update the path and don't forget the slash "/" after your path.

Thank you, Enjoy :)
