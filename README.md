News 0.1
========

This is a simple PHP news portal, I will code it for fun and to sharpen my skills.

Quick and Easy installation
===========================

1- Create Mysql database from any frontend such as "phpmyadmin" if you are working from localhost.

2- Copy the content of "news.sql" to your new database there is one table only for users till this moment.

3- Connect to your database, You need to edit "config.php" file it's very easy to edit it everthing is clear, Edit the path of "news" depending on the location of the script, You can rename the folder as you wish, but don't forget to update the path and don't forget the slash "/" after your path.

4- You can login to the dashboard using username: admin , Password: admin , Then you can edit it as you wish.

Thank you, Enjoy :)
